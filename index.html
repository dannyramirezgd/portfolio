            <p class="bio-p">
                I am a full stack web developer looking to jump head first into the
                field. I have been working for 5 years as a counselor but have always
                found myself as the "tech person" wherever I go. I love to code and
                create things for the internet so I can't imagine a profession I am
                better suited for. I am a U.S. born citizen, but both my parents are
                immigrants from Peru so have a lot of culture and background I bring
                with me. My personal hobbies include board games and video games, as
                well as the new piece of cutting edge tech on the market.
