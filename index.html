      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently pursuing certification as a full
        stack web developer using skills in counseling and interpersonal
        development to create a more holistic approach to web design and client
        relations. I am known for successfully applying critical thinking and problem
        solving strengths to tackle any obstacle and find resolution efficiently
        and effectively. Using my leadership skills, I am able to bring a team of
        fellow students together to create a web application that employs a
        unique CSS framework, multiple server-side APIs, and interactive user
        engagement. I am comfortable working as a team and excited to apply my
        technical skills in a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build
        innovative and engaging experiences on the web.
